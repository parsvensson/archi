# Claude Code Instructions

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full workflow documentation.

## Quick Reference

- **Upstream remote:** `origin` (archimatetool/archi)
- **Fork remote:** `myfork` (parsvensson/archi)
- **Integration branch:** `my-archi` (build releases from here)
- **Feature branches:** `feature/*` (branch from `master`)

## Key Rules

1. New features branch from `master`, not `my-archi`
2. Push to `myfork`, never to `origin`
3. Sync upstream: `master` first, then merge into `my-archi`
